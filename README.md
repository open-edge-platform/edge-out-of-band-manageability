## Overview

Welcome to Intel Edge Out-of-Band Manageability (EOM), a comprehensive solution designed
to streamline and enhance the deployment and management of infrastructure and
applications at the edge. This framework leverages cutting-edge technologies to
provide robust solutions for hardware onboarding, secure workload deployment,
and cluster lifecycle management, all centered around Kubernetes-based
application deployment for edge computing.

## Primary Product: Edge Orchestrator

At the center of Intel Edge Out-of-Band Manageability is Edge Orchestrator, the primary
solution to manage edge environments efficiently and securely. It encompasses a
range of features that cater to the unique demands of edge computing, ensuring
seamless integration and operation across diverse hardware and software
landscapes. Edge Orchestrator is designed to be the central hub for managing
edge infrastructure at scale across
geographically distributed edge sites. It offers multitenancy and
identity & access management for tenants,
dashboards for quick views of status & issue identification, and management of
all infrastructure components including edge nodes (i.e.
hosts).

### Key Components

Edge Orchestrator is used to centrally manage all Edge Nodes at sites and perform lifecycle management of OS
in the managed nodes. Edge Orchestrator consists of the following main components, and it is
deployable on-premises or in the cloud:

- [Edge Infrastructure Manager](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/developer_guide/infra_manager/index.html):
Policy-based secure life cycle management of a fleet of edge nodes/devices at scale, spread across distributed
locations allowing onboarding, provisioning, inventory management, upgrades and more.
- [UI](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-ui): The web user interface for the Edge Orchestrator, allowing the
user to manage most of the features of the product in an intuitive, visual, manner without having to trigger a series
of APIs individually.
- [CLI](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-cli): The command line interface for the Edge Orchestrator,
allowing the user to manage most of the features of the product in an intuitive,
text-based manner without having to trigger a series of APIs individually.
- [Platform Services](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/developer_guide/platform/index.html):
A collection of services that support the deployment and management of the Edge Orchestrator, including identity and
access management, multitenancy management, ingress route configuration, secrets and certificate management, cloud and
on-prem infrastructure life-cycle management and more.

## Get Started

There are multiple ways to begin to learn about, use, or contribute to Edge Orchestrator.

- Start by deploying your own
  orchestrator [in the cloud or on-premises](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/deployment_guide/index.html)
- Read the latest [Release Notes](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/main/release_notes/index.html)
